/**
 * Key:
 * Core:       Method must report whether the key is valid, or
 *             report that it is invalid and give one reason why it is invalid.
 *             To be valid, the key must
 *             - be at least 8 characters and at most 16 characters long,
 *             - not end with the special characters '#' or '$',
 *             - not have a hyphen ('-') character anywhere
 *            
 * Completion: Method should either report that the key is valid, or
 *             report that it is invalid and list ALL the reasons that it is invalid.
 *             To be valid, the key must
 *             - satisfy all of the conditions above AND
 *             - have at least one Upper case character and at least one Lower case character,
 *             - not start with the same character as the first character of the user's name
 *             - contain either a '#' or a '$', but not both.
 * Challenge:  Same as completion, except that to be valid, the key must
 *             - satisfy all of the conditions above AND
 *             - have a mix of numbers and letters
 *             - not contain any "suffix" of the user's name of 2 characters or more in any case.
 *               (eg if name is Peter, it does not contain "er", or "eR" or "ter", or "eTer" or "ETER", or...)
 *
 * Hint.  Look at the documentation in the String class.
 * You will definitely find the length(), endsWith(...), and contains(...) methods to be helpful
